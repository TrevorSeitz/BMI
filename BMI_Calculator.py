Detail about BMI: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index

BMI is calculated using a persons weight and height. BMI is 'weight' devided by square of height.

BMI = weight/(height^2)

The BMI should be classified as follows
Underweight - BMI under or equal to 18.5
Normal - BMI between 18.5 and 25 (not including 18.5 but including 25)
Overweight - BMI between- 25 and 30 (not including 25 but including 30)
Obese - BMI greater than 30

e.g. Input: weight(kg) - 60
            height(m) - 1.9
     Output: Your BMI is 16.6. You are Underweight.

e.g. Input: weight(kg) - 72
            height(m) - 1.84
     Output: Your BMI is 21.3. You are Normal.

e.g. Input: weight(kg) - 72
            height(m) - 1.6
     Output: Your BMI is 27.3. You are Overweight.

e.g. Input: weight(kg) - 70
            height(m) - 1.5
     Output: Your BMI is 31.1. You are Obese.
